# Express/vanilla js SPA "framework"
Not really a framework but a way to create a quick "SPA" with express and vanilla js for prototyping etc

Very much a rip-off of the [dcode](https://github.com/dcode-youtube/single-page-app-vanilla-js) example combined with express-generator generated express app

including [W3.css](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) for styling
