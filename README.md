# Express/vanilla js SPA "framework"
Not really a framework but a way to create a quick "SPA" with express and vanilla js for prototyping etc

Very much a rip-off of the [dcode](https://github.com/dcode-youtube/single-page-app-vanilla-js) example combined with express-generator generated express app

including [W3.css](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) for styling

## Structure
- [frontend/static](frontend/static/) - static files
- [frontend/static/css/](frontend/static/css/) - css files
- [frontend/static/js](frontend/static/js/) - js files
- [frontend/static/js/views/](frontend/static/js/views/) - js files for different "views"


## Usage
1. clone repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start` OR `npm run dev` for nodemon
4. open browser at `localhost:3000`
